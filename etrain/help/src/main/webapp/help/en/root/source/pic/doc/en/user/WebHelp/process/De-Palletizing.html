    <p>De-Palletizing is the process where products are transferred from a pallet to a conveyor to produce a flow of singulated trackable uniquely identified 
    items.</p>
    <p>The De-Palletizing in ACMAP scope is used for fill the Multishuttle Buffer. It uses the standard Lookahead Replenishment for trigger this process.</p>
    <p>In AMCAP scenario it is tried to use the automatic de-palletizing. But in in some case it is not possible to de-palletize products automatically. For 
    example the first layer is not complete, or the product is generally not suitable for automatic de-palletizing. Such decisions has to be made during the 
    teach-in phase. As soon a product was qualified for automatic de-palletizing and the first layer is complete the system will initiate automatic 
    de-palletizing otherwise manual de-palletizing has to use.</p>

    <h5>De-Palletizing Process</h5>
    <p>The de-palletizing in DCD is part of PIC and use the standard PIC entities like PickMissions and Picks. Thereby each PickMission represents one 
    source load unit (pallet) and for each SKU on it one pick with the quantity is created. The basic decision between automatic and manual de-palletizing is 
    made during the creation of the pick missions. Thereby following checks are performed:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li>First of all the flag &quot;isAutoDepalletize&quot;, which is set during the teach-in is checked. If at least one item on the pallet exists, where is flag 
      is not set, the complete pallet is to de-palletized at a manual de-palletizing station.</li>
      <li>Also in the case, when the pallet is too high for the automatic de-palletizing, a manual de-palletizing station is used. A pallet is too high, when 
      the current height is greater than the configured maximum height of its load unit type.</li>
      <li>Afterwards the top layer is checked and when it is not complete, a manual de-palletizing station is used. This check is done on the SKU, which is on 
      the top of the pallet. The quantity of this SKU must be completely dividable with the quantity of one layer of this SKU. This information about the 
      quantity per layer is on the SKULUCapacity entity connected for the current SKU quantity unit. There is a mapping configuration from the pallet&#39;s load 
      unit type to the layer load unit type, which is described in detail
      <a href="../../../../../../wms/cng/doc/en/user/WebHelp/lms/CDPropertiesAndBatches/SystemProperties/controlDataProperties_LUT.html">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the workstation with the type &quot;AMCAP Depal&quot; or &quot;Manual Depal&quot; is found the PickMission (e.g. the source pallet) is assigned to it and requested to 
    the workstation.</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li>For automatic de-palletizers the source pallet is requested to the workstation location of type &quot;De-Wrap&quot;.</li>
      <li>For manual de-palletizers the source pallet is requested to the workstation location of type &quot;Virtual&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On arrival at the requested workstation location of type De-Wrap (only for automatic de-palletizers) the first step is to check and dewrap of requested 
    layers. Also here there are differences of automatic and manual de-palletizers. In case of a automatic de-palletizer the pallets arrives at a location, 
    which is before the actual de-palletizing location. This is the previously mentioned workstation location of type &quot;De-Wrap&quot;. Here the operator has to check 
    the pallet, whether it can be de-palletized automatically or not. He/she has the possibility directly start the automatic de-palletizing process or send the 
    pallet to the clarification station for further checks or send it to a manual de-palletizing station. Also a reroute, e.g. try to find another automatic 
    workstation can be triggered at this position. If during reroute no another automatic de-palletizer can be found, the pallet is send back to the bulk 
    storage.<br>
    For the de-wrap dialog description see:
    <a href="../dialogs/pic/amcapdepal/ui/client/dialog/dewrap/DeWrapOperationDialog.html">De-Wrap dialog</a>.</p>
    <p>On the other hand the arrival at a manual de-palletizing station has to be confirmed manually (via FLS) or automatic (via MFC) on a one of the 
    workstation locations of type &quot;Source&quot;. Because the decision on which of the available source locations the pallet is to de-palletized as next is by the 
    operator (or an underlying system like MFC), the workstation locations of type &quot;Virtual&quot; and of type &quot;Source&quot; must be in the same group.<br>
    As soon the pallet is booked on one of the available source locations, the further processing is done by the
    <a href="../dialogs/pic/manualdepal/ui/client/dialog/manualdepal/ManualDepalOperationDialog.html">Manual De-Palletizing Dialog</a>.</p>

    <h5>Workstation determination</h5>
    <p>The decision between automatic and manual de-palletizer is made at pick mission creation. Thereby the service qualifier of the pick mission is set to &quot;Amcap 
    Depal&quot; or to &quot;Manual Depal&quot;. Afterwards it is clear on which type of workstation a pick mission is to process.</p>
    <p>There are 3 positions where the concrete workstation for a pick mission is determined.</p>
    <ol class="listNumber">
      <li>At pick mission release.</li>
      <li>With a specific demon &quot;AssignPickMissionsToDepalletizersDemon&quot;.</li>
      <li>Reassignment due to workstation shutdown.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="style2">Thereby all available and release pick missions are considered, which have no assignment to a workstation yet. Here the assignment is only 
    the setting of the pick mission attribute &quot;lastAssignedTerminal&quot;, where the ID of the workstation is saved. The actual assignment, where the pick mission is 
    put into the queue of the workstation is done later.</p>
    <p class="style2">The determination starts with following parameters:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li>&nbsp;List of pick missions, where lastAssignedTerminal is not yet set.</li>
      <li>List of the depalletizer stations of the correct type, e.g. for pick missions with service qualifier &quot;Amcap Depal&quot; only workstations of type &quot;Amcap 
      Depal&quot; for pick missions with service qualifier &quot;Manual Depal&quot; only workstations of type &quot;Manual Depal&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From the given pick missions and depalletizer stations (workstations) such assignment is chosen, which fits best. This is done as follow:</p>
    <ol class="listNumber">
      <li>For all in the pick mission available SKU the demand in different aisles is determined.</li>
      <li>For each pick mission the number of available layers is determined.</li>
      <li class="style2">For the each combination of pick mission and de-palletizer workstation the iATCost and a weight is calculated:<ol class="listNumber">
        <li class="style2">With iATCost the minimum inter aisle transfers for current combination</li>
        <li class="style2">The weight is calculated with a relation between the number of layers and the iATCost (#layers/iATCost).</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li class="style2">The assignment of the given pick missions is done in the order of the less workload of the workstations, e.g. workstations with no 
      assignment is considered first and then the workstations with complete assignment.<br>
      With this all workstations are filled with the best pick missions, which are for it.</li>

          This is actually a standard lookahead demon and not part of de-palletizing. But this is mentioned here, because this is the first step to start 
          de-palletizing. This demon looks at the demand of the orders with service qualifier &quot;RapidPal&quot; (in AMCAP scope), which is not yet available in the 
          Multishuttle buffer and create a replenishment order for the missing demand.<br>
          The new created replenishment orders have the service qualifier &quot;Amcap Depal&quot; and later it is changed to &quot;Manual Depal&quot; if the pallet cannot be 
          de-palletized manually. Because the order can have many pallets in it, changing the service qualifier is not possible at this stage. Thus changing 
          service qualifier is only on the level of the pick missions.</td>

    <h5>Automatic De-Palletizing</h5>
    <p>As described above the decision, whether a pallet can be de-palletized automatically or manually is made during release of the order. And in the case of 
    automatic de-palletizing the pallets are send to a location in front of the de-palletizer, where the de-wrap process is performed. Afterwards the pallet is 
    ready for automatic de-palletizing.</p>
    <p>The communication with the underlying de-palletizing system is via DCI telegrams, which can be tracked with in the Message Manager dialog of DCD. For a

    <h5>Manual De-Palletizing</h5>
    <p>Here a briefly overview about the process is given. For details see:
    <a href="../dialogs/pic/manualdepal/ui/client/dialog/manualdepal/ManualDepalOperationDialog.html">Manual De-Palletizing Dialog</a>.</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="img/ManualDepalletizingStation.jpg"></p>
    <p>The pallets for manual de-palletizing are transported to a virtual location of the workstation. With the booking at a concrete source location the dialog 
    can start the de-palletizing process. Thereby depended on the configuration one to many source locations can be used.</p>
    <table class="noteTable">
      <tr>
        <td class="noteCell">
          <p class="notePar">&nbsp;INFO&nbsp;</p>
        </td>
        <td class="noteTextCell">
          <p class="noteTextPar">Because of dialog layout 5 locations can be visible. If more than 5 locations are configured, the dialog layout has to be 
          adjusted.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After de-wrapping and other pre-checks on the pallet the actual de-palletizing process is started. Thereby for each item following procedure is used:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li>The operator put the item from the pallet and put it on the moveable conveyor.</li>
      <li>The item is conveyed throw a barcode scanner, which read all available barcodes on it.<br>
      Up to 5 barcodes can be read from scanner.</li>
      <li>All barcodes are send to DCD and the system looks for the open pick. </li>
      <li>If the pick can be found, it is confirmed and the dialog is updated. Otherwise interaction and manual search is necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The communication with the barcode scanner is also with DCI. Here a short description of the telegrams:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>
          <p class="columnDescription">Telegram</p>
        </th>
        <th>
          Direction</th>
        <th>
          Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="tableBodyText">BARP</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p class="tableBodyText">Scanner -&gt; DCD</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p class="tableBodyText">This &quot;Barcode Response&quot; is send with an unique location of the current workstation and up to 5 barcodes. The location is 
          fixed within the scanner and not changeable.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The current position of the cart can be determined within the dialog. Therefore two DCI telegrams are used:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>
          <p class="columnDescription">Telegram</p>
        </th>
        <th>
          Direction</th>
        <th>
          Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="tableBodyText">STRP</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          Dialog -&gt; PLC</td>
        <td>
          <p class="tableBodyText">Ask PLC about the current position. As deviceId the front position of the workstation is used, e.g. the work location.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="tableBodyText">STPO</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          PLC -&gt; Dialog</td>
        <td>
          This is the response on STRP and contains for the given deviceId the current position in mm.</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
    <p>The returned position is used for determine the actual source location of the cart. For the position range configuration see:

    <h5>Partial De-Palletizing</h5>
    <p>This function can be used to de-palletize a pallet partially. For example if a pallet has many layers and de-wrapping of all layers at once can cause the 
    fall of the items, the operator at the De-Wrap station can select how many layers are de-wrapped in one process. If not the complete number of layers are 
    entered, which are actually to de-palletized, the pallet is send back to the de-wrap location of the current workstation for the next round.</p>
    <p>This function can be parameterized for each workstation in the

    <h5>Preventive Calibration</h5>
    <p>In periods where the workload for a de-palletizer is low, it is possible to do preventive calibration. For this purpose, pallets with new products can be 
    brought to the de-palletizer for calibration of the picking program.</p>
    <p>The operator at the de-wrap station is informed, that the current pallet is for preventive calibration, that he/she de-wrap only the first layer. After 
    the calibration the pallet returns to the de-wrap location, where the operator is requested to wrap the pallet. Afterwards the pallet is stored into the 
    bulk area.</p>
    <p>The preventive calibration starts only, if following fulfills:</p>
    <ol class="listNumber">
      <li>If for a palletizing quantity unit and load unit type no de-palletizing program exists.</li>
