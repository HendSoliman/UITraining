    <h5><a name="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h5>
    <p>AMCAP stands for <strong>A</strong>utomatic <strong>M</strong>ixed <strong>Ca</strong>se <strong>P</strong>alletizing and is completely provided by DCD. 
    AMCAP is intended to be a sub-system that seamlessly integrates with a customer&#39;s overall warehouse operations and covers high performance order assembly, 
    especially for production of heterogeneous pallets and roll cages.</p>
    <p>The AMCAP system is usually not a standalone and exclusive system within a customer&#39;s environment. In most cases it will be integrated with other 
    warehousing activities focusing on the handling of products with specific characteristics. Therefore, AMCAP-related business processes need to be integrated 
    with other processes which may either be controlled by a Dematic system or by a non-Dematic system.</p>

    <h5>Components</h5>
    <p>An AMCAP system use various components of DCD. The next figure gives an overview over these elements.</p>
    <p class="CaptionBody">Figure 1: AMCAP Overview</p>
    <p class="graphic"><img src="img/LMS_AMCAP_Overview.png"></p>
    <h3>Teach-In Station (1)</h3>
    <p>The Teach-In Station is used to collect all required information on products which are handled in the AMCAP subsystem. This affects the basic decision 
    whether or not a product or item can be handled by AMCAP at all, as well as all handling operations, including de-palletizing, conveying, storage and 
    palletizing.</p>
    <h3>Bulk Pallet Store (2)</h3>
    <p>The bulk store serves as a volume buffer for products to be replenished into the AMCAP subsystem. This is typically an AS/RS system where products are 
    stored on single-SKU pallets. </p>
    <p>The bulk store is not considered an integral part of the AMCAP subsystem.</p>
    <h3>Inbound Pallet Conveyor (3)</h3>
    <p>The inbound pallet conveyor is used to take pallets from the bulk pallet store to the de-palletizing stations. Depending on the type of de-palletizing, 
    suitable workstations must be addressed.</p>
    <p>In addition, it is also responsible for removal of empty pallets as well as put-away of partly de-palletized pallets.</p>
    <h3>Automatic De-Palletizer (4)</h3>
    <p>The automatic device</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li>picks a certain number of units from a pallet (usually a layer)</li>
      <li>and places them on a take-away conveyor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Automatic de-palletizing typically requires that the product as well as the specific pallet are suitable for automatic de-palletizing. In addition, also 
    the quantity to be de-palletized must be suitable for automatic processing.</p>
    <h3>Manual De-Palletizer (5)</h3>
    <p>The manual de-palletizing station is used for all situations where de-palletizing cannot be handled automatically. Manual workstations may also serve a 
    backup for automatic ones of for a coverage of peak loads. Depending on details of the layout, manual and automatic de-palletizing may be mutually 
    exclusive. Despite from automated and manual operations, the de-palletizing result from both workstations is the same.</p>
    <h3>Distributor (6)</h3>
    <font SIZE="3">
    <p>This device receives de-palletized packaging units from the de-palletizer and creates a flow of single items having a definite orientation. This device 
    is responsible for the correct distribution of product items with a de-fined orientation to the different MS buffers according to target specifications 
    provided by the Warehouse Control System (WCS).&nbsp; For this purpose, the Distributor needs to be equipped with product identification and product 
    orientation devices.&nbsp; Conveying of items is tray-less. Inbound throughput must not be less than the outbound throughput in order to assure continuous 
    operation of the entire sys-tem. According to the current design, the Distributor device is built with straight con-veyors connecting every de-palletizer 
    with two Multishuttle aisles where a pusher is used for transversal movements. To achieve the required throughput, items are not handles as singles but as 
    groups of items of the same type (slugs).</p>
    <p>The device needs to assure the following:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
        <li>Items are conveyed without trays; they need to be tracked on the conveyor.</li>
        <li>The device need to be able to correctly identify items with respect to their spatial extent and their identity. For this purpose, the expected item 
dimension are available for comparision.</li>
        <li>Items may need to be turned and toppled before being conveyed. For example, items with a high center of gravity need to be put down for conveying and 
storage.<br>
Whether reorientation of an item is required is preset based on the SKU information.</li>
        <li>items need to be handed over to the Multishuttle with a distinct orientation. The correct orientation of each individual item is essential for MS Flex.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Multishuttle Buffer (7)</h3>
    <p>For tray-less storage and sequenced retrieval of product items, the Multishuttle Flex Gen II is used.</p>
    <p>MS Flex provides capabilities to handle highly dynamic carton and tote with variable sizes of units.</p>
    <p>For details on MS Flex see:
    <a href="../../../../../../cor/doc/en/user/WebHelp/dialogs/cor/storage/ui/client/dialog/location/SlotDetailDialog.html">SlotDetailDialog</a></p>
    </font>
    <h3>Inter-Aisle transfer (8)</h3>
    <font SIZE="3">
    <p>For stock adjustments across the individual buffers it is required to support trans-fer of items across different aisles. This is especially the case 
    when de-palletized items are required in aisles which are not directly connected to the de-palletizer. An other application is the case where items need to 
    be relocated after storage to an aisle different from the aisle where they have been initially stored. </p>
    <p>Inter-Aisle Transfer use specific bays in an aisle where a shuttle may push items to the next aisle. Using multiple transfers of this kind, items can be 
    brought to any location in any buffer.</p>
    </font>
    <h3>Outbound Item Conveyor (9)</h3>
    <font SIZE="3">
    <p>This conveyor is used to supply items to the palletizing stations. The conveying system needs to verify that the correct items in the correct se-quence 
    and orientation arrive at the palletizing stations. If necessary, items need to be reoriented before handover to the palletizer. For this purpose, product 
    verification and orientation devices need to be inte-grated. </p>
    </font>
    <h3>&nbsp;Palletizing Workstations (10)</h3>
    <font SIZE="3">
    <p>At these workstations, pallets or roll cages are built from the product items and automatically wrapped. </p>
    <p>The typical workstation is an automatic palletizing device (RapidPall cell). In specific installations, it is also possible to use a manual workstation 
    (ERGOPALL) for one or several workstations. </p>
    <p>Optionally, the palletizing workstation includes a camera which allows taking a video of the palletizing process for every pallet as well as a picture of 
    the final result. </p>
    </font>
    <h3>Outbound Pallet Conveyor (11)</h3>
    <font SIZE="3">
    <p>This conveyor is used for staging empty pallets or roll cages and for removal of completed pallets or roll cages.</p>

    <h5>Constraints</h5>
    <p>Some basic design decisions have been made which are essential for the overall operation as well as for the IT system:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li>Each palletizer is assigned to exact one aisle. This allows to achieve the highest throughput rates per aisle which can be reached with a Multishuttle 
      system. Also the sequencing across multiple aisle is avoided by this constraint.</li>
      <li>Tray-less transport of items</li>
      <li>Usage of Multishuttle Flex Gen II for storage of single items.</li>
      <li>Inter-aisle transfer (iAT) capabilities allow for transfer of stock between buffers on demand after initial storage.</li>

    <h5>Process</h5>
    <p>The following figure shows a high level overview on the inbound an outbound processes within a warehouse or a distribution center. The sub-processes 
    including AMCAP-related activities are highlighted.</p>
    <p class="CaptionBody">Figure 2: Process Overview</p>
    <p class="graphic"><img src="img/LMS_AMCAP_Process.png"></p>
    <h3>Receiving</h3>
    <font SIZE="3">
    <p>AMCAP requires detailed information on the products which are going to be palletized automatically. </p>
    <p>For example, product dimensions are required for pallet generation as well as for storage within Multishuttle Flex. Tray-less transport of products 
    requires information on maximum conveying velocity or acceleration allowed. Many more details may be required in order to assure faultless handling of 
    products within the AMCAP system.</p>
    <p>Measuring of products is usually to be done during the receiving process before storage in the bulk area. This is because the automatic replenishment 
    requires already specific product information for secure handling. </p>
      <h3>Order Planning</h3>
    <p>The first step is the creation of an order, which is normally transferred from an ERP system or from other sources. Depending on the need of the order 
    the products are replenished from the bulk area.</p>
    <p>As soon the need of the order is fulfilled pallet planning can be started.</p>
      <h3>Replenishment</h3>
    <p>The replenishment process shall support the essential AMCAP principle to do order-related distribution on the inbound side rather than cross-aisle 
    sequencing on the outbound side. Therefore, the replenishment process needs to generate a distribution of stock within the different aisles which allows to 
    continuously build pallets on all active palletizers. </p>
    <p>This requires, in general, a pre-allocation of orders (or sub-orders) to specific aisles considering the requirement to balance load across the 
    palletizers.</p>
    <p>In typical scenarios, the system will determine the demand for a certain look-ahead period, which may be an entire day, a shift or a shorter period. </p>
    <p>Automatic de-palletizing of single-SKU layers produces flows of items of the same kind. Depending on the de-palletizer, specific restrictions can be 
    imposed to the structure of pallets and layers. For example, it can be enforced that layers need to be complete in order to be de-palletized automatically.
    </p>
    <p>Manual de-palletizing workstations can be used as backup for automatic work-stations, in order to cover peak loads and for de-palletizing those pallets 
    which cannot be handled automatically. </p>
    <p>Mixed pallets are de-palletized manually, except for &quot;rainbow&quot; pallets, consisting of a sequence of single-SKU layers. </p>
    <p>In either case, the result of de-palletizing is a flow of individual items on the in-bound Case Conveyor.</p>
    <p>Before storage in the MS Flex various checks are to perform. Depending on project specific restrictions, only a subset of actions may be applied.</p>
      <ul class="listBullet1">
        <li><strong>Scanning (optional)<br>
        </strong>Reads the barcodes which can be found the item and evaluates these.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo taking (optional)<br>
        </strong>The system takes a photo from every individual item.</li>
        <li><strong>Orientation<br>
        </strong>Items are rotated and/or tilted into an orientation which has been predefined during the teaching process for each product.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement<br>
        </strong>For every individual items the dimensions length, width and height are determined.</li>
        <li class="style1"><strong>Weighting (optional)<br>
        </strong>For every individual item, the weight is determined.</li>
        <li><strong>Item Verification</strong><font SIZE="3"><p>The system compares expected data for dimensions, weight and inventory attributes with 
        information obtained from measurement and barcode analysis. Depending on specific rules and algorithms, items are rated as accept-able or faulty and 
        directed to the Multishuttle storage or to a reject lane. </p>
        </font></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Order Fulfillment</h3>
    <p>The Order Fulfillment sub-process is started for an individual aisle whenever the number of pallets already planned for that aisle is less than a certain 
    threshold. </p>
    <p>After replenishment in the Multishuttle Flex the best candidate for execution is selected first. The selected order is send to packbuilder and is 
    planned. After the planning, product items for each planned pallet are allocated to the order to prevent usage for other order.</p>
    <p>Retrieval of units for a pallet is started automatically after the last item of the previous pallet has been retrieved. This sub-process involves also 
    the following actions. Depending on project specific restrictions, only a subset of actions may be applied.</p>
      <ul class="listBullet1">
        <li><strong>Orientation</strong><br>
        Items are rotated and/or toppled into a orientation which is to be used for palletizing.</li>
        <li><strong>Item Verification</strong><br>
        The system compares expected data for dimensions which information obtained form measurement. This is used to assure that the expected item is being 
        palletizing in order to avoid accidental sequencing or handling errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo taking (optional)</strong><br>
        The system takes a photo from every individual item before it is being palletized.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>At the end the items are palletized in the AMCAP-cell. This process includes also an optional video capture of the palletizing process.</p>
    <p>To avoid concurrency in the fulfillment some restrictions are given:</p>
      <ul class="listBullet1">
        <li>Items are only allocated to an order if they are definitely planned for a pallet.</li>
        <li>The determination of a candidate order takes only those items of the actual aisle into account which are not yet allocated to an order.</li>
        <li>Only one pallet is being planned for an aisle at a time.</li>
        <li>Iventory allocation is done after cubing for those items planned for a pallet.&nbsp;</li>
