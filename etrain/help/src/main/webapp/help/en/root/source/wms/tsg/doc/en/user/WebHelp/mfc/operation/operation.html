    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>In a sunny day scenario the MFC does not require any user interaction in order to perform its everyday life tasks. It just receives transport orders from 
    the superimposed system, carries them out and confirms them back to the host.</p>
    <p>In case of faults the MFC provides dialogs to analyze problems on the transport level. Typical questions are: &quot;Why is box xyz not moving?&quot; or &quot;Why has 
    box xyz been redirected to destination abc?&quot;. Such error diagnostics is possible for life data (i.e. still open transport orders) as well as for historic 
    data (i.e. transport orders which have already been completed, e.g. with a wrong destination).</p>
    <p>There are also mechanisms to recover faulty transport orders.</p>

    <h5>General Approach</h5>
    <p>Please keep the following principle in mind when recovering from fault situations:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li>Tray to get a thorough understanding of what went wrong (esp. when there are complaints like &quot;nothing works anymore&quot;). No actions should be taken 
      until it is clear what happened. The tools provided therefore are described in the chapter
          <a href="#ErrorDiagnostics">Error Diagnostics</a>.</li>
      <li>Error recovery means to resynchronize the physics with the data. This resynchronization always has to happen bottom up: PLC --&gt; MFC --&gt; superimposed 
      host system.<br>
      In this chain the lower system report the result of their actions to the higher ones.</li>
      <li>Be aware that the clarification might no be complete when only the MFC level is re-synchronized.</li>
      <li>Although the MFC tries to be as fault tolerant as possible, the MFC never triggers critical recovery actions automatically. The final decision on 
      error recovery is always upto the end user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <table class="noteTable">
      <tr>
        <td class="noteCell">
          <p class="notePar">&nbsp;DANGER&nbsp;</p>
        </td>
        <td class="noteTextCell">
          <p class="noteTextPar">The improper use of fault recovery actions can cause severe damage to the integrity of the whole system since these actions can 
          only perform a limited plausiblization.<br>
          Thus, please make sure you know what you are doing when using this functionality!!!</p>        </td>

    <p>The MFC provides the following screens to display transport level information which can be used for analyzing problems.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Show currently active transport orders (and transport units)</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These dialogs show the status of all transport orders currently being active within the MFC (i.e. which have not yet been confirmed to the superimposed 
    host system). </p>
    <table class="noteTable">
      <tr>
        <td class="noteCell">
          <p class="notePar">&nbsp;INFO&nbsp;</p>
        </td>
        <td class="noteTextCell">
          <p class="noteTextPar">The partial source of a transport order is always the transport point at which the PLC has most recently reported the transport 
          unit. Please be aware, that this transport point may differ from the current location of the transport unit.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>For each transport order the corresponding TU-Log is shown (see next paragraph for further information). The last log entry is also shown in the 
    (upper) table of the transport order. This information is especially helpful to find out why a transport unit is not moving.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Transport Order&quot; dialog is the starting point for the fault recovery (see
    <a href="#FaultRecovery">below</a>). Besides that, the user can only change the priority of a transport order. Click
    <a href="../../../../../../../../mfc/gwt/doc/en/user/WebHelp/dialogs/mfc/gwt/traorder/client/dialog/TraOrderDialog.html">here</a> to find more information on the 
    &quot;Transport Orders&quot; dialog.</p>
    <p>For the vehicle subsystem and the multishuttle subsystem there are special variants of the transport order dialog which show all transport orders 
    currently being active in a certain aisle combined with the status information of that aisle. This gives the end user the possibility to see at one glance 
    what is going on in an aisle. Please refer to the online help for further information (<span class="style1">vehicle</span>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Transport unit log</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The transport unit log reflects the lifecycle of a transport unit while being active within the MFC, i.e. from the creation of a transport order until it 
    is eventually confirmed back to the superimposed host system. The transport unit log is kept after the transport order completes. Thus, it can be used to 
    analyze historic movements.</p>
    <p>Since a concrete transport unit can be move more than once within the warehouse an additional identifier TU-key is introduced. Using this key it is 
    possible to distinguish between individual transports of the same transport unit.</p>
    <p>Whilst being quite technical, the transport unit log is fully internationalized and thus should also be readable to the experienced end user.</p>
    <table class="noteTable">
      <tr>
        <td class="noteCell">
          <p class="notePar">&nbsp;INFO&nbsp;</p>
        </td>
        <td class="noteTextCell">
          <p class="noteTextPar">To make this log really useful, it is important that also project specific extensions of the core business functionality reflect 
          their decisions in the log. Click

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The TU-Log can be accessed via the menu &quot;MFC --&gt; System --&gt; Transportunit Log&quot;. For active transport orders the log is shown below the transport orders 
    table.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Equipment Status and PLC connection state</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This dialog shows - in individual tabs - the current status of the transport equipment as it has been reported by the PLC. In general, the granularity of 
    this information less detailed as it is shown in a visualization system (e.g. WinCC). Click
    <a href="../../../../../../../../mfc/doc/en/user/WebHelp/dialogs/mfc/core/ui/ftStat/client/dialog/FtStatDialog.html">here</a> for further information on this dialog.</p>
    <table class="noteTable">

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>In addition to displaying of pure status information, this dialog also offers the possibility to lock and to unlock individual equipment elements, e.g. 
    an aisle or a connection. See
    <a href="#StandardOperations">below</a> for further details.</p>
    <p>The &quot;PLC connection state&quot; dialog shows the whether the MFC has a network connection to the subordinate PLC. Click
    <a href="../../../../../../../../mfc/doc/en/user/WebHelp/dialogs/mfc/core/ui/messagetrace/client/dialog/MessageTraceOverviewDialog.html">here</a> for further information on this 
    dialog.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Transport Archive</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each insert and update operation of the central entities transport orders and transport units is archived in the database. This information is accessible 
    via the menu &quot;MFC --&gt; Archive&quot;. The archive data is kept after the transport order completes. Thus, it can be used to analyze historic movements.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Modify User&quot; column denotes the DbTM name of the transport subsystem which triggered the change in the database. Together with the timestamp this 
    information can be used to find the trace file which holds the related business transaction.</p>
    <p>Since this information is very technical it is not intended for the end user in the first place, but more for service personnel. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Message Trace</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>All telegrams which have been sent to the PLC resp. which have been received from the PLC are logged in the message trace. The log always contains the 
    original raw data which have been exchanged, i.e. no further processing has happened. A double click on trace line shows the individual fields of the 
    telegram in a better readable format.</p>
    <table class="noteTable">

    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Syslog</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The MFC writes syslog messages to document important decisions and error situations. These messages can are displayed in the &quot;System Log&quot; dialog. Click

    <p>The following functionality is offered:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet2">
      <li><i>Locking / unlocking of a transport order</i><br>
      A locked transport order will not be processed any more by the MFC. This functionality can be used to &quot;park&quot; faulted transport orders until they can be 
      finally clarified.</li>      
      <li><i>Resume a transport order</i><br>
      This functional can be used to recover rejected transport order after the cause of the rejection (e.g. a missing connection) has been fixed. From a 
      technical point of view the functionality is identical to an &quot;Arrive at&quot; at the current location of the transport unit.</li>
      <li><i>Back to partial source</i><br>
      This functionality books the transport unit back to the partial source to the connection it is currently traveling on. As a consequence, the transport 
      telegram for the actual connection is repeated. The execution of this task is delegated to the strategy of the current transport subsystem.</li>
      <li><i>Confirm current connection</i><br>
      This functionality finishes the current connection and places the transport unit on the destination of this connection. The transport order is continued 
      from this transport point normally.</li>
      <li><i>Arrive at Location ...<br>
      </i>The user can specify the location the transport unit shall be placed on. The transport order is continued from this new location. If the given 
      location is equal to the global destination of the transport order, the user is asked if the transport shall be finished. If there are no possible 
      connections between the global source of the transport order and the new given location, an error message is displayed.</li>
      <li><i>Back to global source</i><br>
      The transport is re-started from its global source.</li>
      <li><i>Change global destination</i><br>
      The user can specify a new location which shall be used as global destination for the transport order. If there are no possible connections between the 
      current location of the transport order and the new given destination, an error message is displayed. The transport order is not redirected on the fly, 
      i.e. the change of the global destination takes only effect after the next routing which is triggered when arriving at the next notification point.</li>
      <li><i>Delete transport order</i><br>
      This functionality deletes the transport order at its current location. A host confirmation is sent with error code &quot;ABORT_DELETED&quot;, if necessary.</li>
      <li><i>Confirm transfer order<br>
      </i>The transport order is finished at its global destination. A positive host confirmation is sent, if necessary.</li>
      <li><i>Confirm transfer order at a different location …<br>
      </i>The user can specify a location at which the transport order is finished. A positive host confirmation is sent, if necessary.</li>
      <li>Cancel transfer order<br>
      The transport unit is placed on the global source of the transport order and the transport order is deleted without further plausiblization. A positive 
      cancellation message is sent to the host, if necessary.</li>

    <p>This functionality is rarely required, since the resending of telegrams can also be trigged by the recovery actions of transport orders, e.g. a &quot;back to 
    partial source&quot; triggers the re-sending of the corresponding transport telegram. The using the transport orders recovery actions is more convenient and 
    secure and should always be preferred.</p>
    <p>In the following scenarios the resending of PLC telegrams are useful:</p>
    <ul class="listBullet2">
      <li>The MFC logic handling a PLC telegram is flawed but no rollback happened so that the PLC telegram is lost. </li>

    <h5>Examples</h5>
    <p>The chapter gives some example which show how the fault recovery mechanisms described above can be used in typical error scenarios.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Booking of movements carried out at the sub-ordinate level.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Due to a fault at the PLC level a transport unit has been moved at the subordinate levenl to another location within the warehouse . No PLC telegram could 
    be sent which might reflect this subordinate movement.</p>
    <p>The &quot;Arrive At Location...&quot; functionality can be used to re-synchronize the MFC. The transport will be continued from this new location.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Transport unit has been removed form the PLC.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>A transport unit has broken down on and cannot be moved any more. The PLC level mission is deleted at the operators panel (together with any potential 
    tracking information). In general, this is signaled to the MFC by an event code &#39;TD&#39;.</p>
    <table class="noteTable">
      <tr>
        <td class="noteCell">
          <p class="notePar">&nbsp;INFO&nbsp;</p>
        </td>
        <td class="noteTextCell">
          <p class="noteTextPar">The standard MFC functionality does not trigger any action upon &#39;TD&#39; but just reject the transport order. This gives the end user 
          the flexibility to decide on a per case base how to recover from the situation (e.g. it is possible to reconstruct the transport unit and continue 
          from an induct station). </p>        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In case the transport unit cannot be recovered, the user can select the transport order within the MFC GUI and has to delete it manually. </p>
    <p>Special variants thereof are sending a confirmation which signals the hosts that the box has arrived at the destination or sending a cancellation which 
    signals that the box is still at the global source.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Recovery after a flawed configuration within the MFC</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The host sent a transport to the MFC, but due to a flawed configuration the MFC has set the status of the transport order to rejected.</p>
    <p>After having corrected the problem, the transport order can be resumed by using the &quot;Resume a transport order&quot; functionality which resets the transport 
    order into status active.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Recovery after an software update during commissioning</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    This scenario describes techniques to continue a transport order which has been interrupted due to a software flaw. No general strategy can be given, but 
    the following rules of thumb apply:</p>
    <p>
    If the arrival telegram could by handled correctly, but the subsequent transport mission could not be sent anymore, use the fault recovery action &quot;back to 
    partial source&quot; to trigger a re-sent.</p>
    <p>
    If the arrival could not be booked correctly, e.g. important project specific tailored functionality has not been processed correctly. This has to be 
    rectified first (according to the principle &quot;synchronize PLC and MFC&quot;). One approach might be to resent the PLC telegram or to release the internal DbTM 
    telegram (which is in status locked in case of a rollback).</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Redirection to clearing station</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Transport orders can be redirected to the clearing station by using the fault recovery action &quot;Change global destination&quot;.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Prevent transport units from moving on</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    A transport unit can be stopped during its journey by locking the transport order. This might be especially useful when the transport order is still in the 
    outbound queue of a crane subsystem, i.e. has not yet begun to move.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="listBullet1">
      <li><b>Clearance of bogus UFO transport orders</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Due to irregular telegrams having been received from the PLC, the MFC might generate bogus
    <span class="style1">UFO</span> transport orders, i.e. UFO orders which do not correspond to a physical transport unit. The transport 
    orders can be removed from the MFC database by the fault recovery action &quot;Delete transport order&quot;.</p>
    <p>No host confirmation will be sent, since UFO orders are MFC internal transport orders.</p>
